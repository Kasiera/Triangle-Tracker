Triangle Tracker
This is a Triangle Tracker as created by Samuel Kasiera with the guidance of my peer partners and technical mentors. This summarizes my second week's learning curve at Moringa School. This application will give the user feedback on the type of triangle based on the figures they input.

Description
The intention and use of this application is to show the user the different types of triangles based on their lengths. It also informs the user if such a triangle exists or not. The application also shows the steps followed.

Setup/Installation Requirements
Installation is as per the browser's settings

Format
This software will easily run on any server

Known Bugs
No known bugs and should any occur, an update will be issued within the hour.

Technologies Used
The language used to run this application is English. The applications used to make the application are terminal, atom, as well as google chrome. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}
